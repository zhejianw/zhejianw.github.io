I am **Zhejian Wang**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the **University of Delaware**.  
My research explores the intersection of **digital technology, education, and development**, focusing on how policy interventions shape youth behavior and learning outcomes.  
Combining **causal inference methods** with large-scale data from China, I study the welfare implications of digital regulation in emerging economies.  

My job-market paper, *“Restricting Video Games in China: Effects on Time Use, Educational Achievement, and Health,”* examines China’s 2021 restriction on minors’ video gaming, showing that while the policy sharply reduced online activity, its educational benefits remain limited.

I am currently on the **2025–26 academic job market** and welcome opportunities to discuss my research and teaching.
