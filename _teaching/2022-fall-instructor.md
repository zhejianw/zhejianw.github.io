### Courses Taught
- **Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON 101)** – Fall 2022  
- **Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON 103)** – Spring 2023  

As an **Instructor (Discussion Sections)**, I independently led weekly sessions for large introductory economics courses. Students registered for my sections separately from the main lecture, and I was responsible for preparing materials, delivering instruction, grading assignments, and holding office hours.  

These courses emphasized applying core economic principles to real-world problems. In each session, I integrated short empirical exercises and policy examples to reinforce theoretical concepts and build students’ analytical and quantitative skills.
