I am **Zhejian Wang**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the **University of Delaware**.  
My research examines how **digital regulations and technology access** shape youth behavior and human capital formation in emerging economies.  
I combine **quasi-experimental methods**—such as difference-in-differences and regression-kink designs—with large-scale survey and administrative data from China.  

My job-market paper, *“Restricting Video Games in China: Effects on Time Use, Educational Achievement, and Health,”* studies the 2021 gaming restriction for minors, highlighting how behavioral policies affect learning and well-being.
