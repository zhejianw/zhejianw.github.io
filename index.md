# Welcome!

I am **Zhejian Wang**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Delaware.  
My research focuses on **development economics**, **education**, and **digital policy**, 
examining how technology access and government interventions shape youth time use and human capital formation.

My **Job Market Paper**, *"Restricting Video Games in China: Effects on Time Use, Educational Achievement, and Health"*,  
analyzes Chinaâ€™s 2021 gaming restrictions for minors using nationally representative microdata and quasi-experimental methods.  
The paper is currently under **major revision** at the *Journal of Development Economics*.

You can find my [CV here](files/CV_Zhejian_Wang.pdf) and learn more about my [Research](/research/) and [Teaching](/teaching/).
