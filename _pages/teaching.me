## Instructor

**Undergraduate Courses**, Department of Economics, University of Delaware (2022–2023)

- *Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON 101)* — Fall 2022  
- *Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON 103)* — Spring 2023  

As an Instructor (Discussion Sections), I independently led weekly sessions for large introductory economics courses.  
Students registered for my sections separately from the main lecture, and I was responsible for preparing materials, delivering instruction, grading assignments, and holding office hours.  
These courses emphasized applying core economic principles to real-world problems. In each session, I integrated short empirical exercises and policy examples to reinforce theoretical concepts and build students’ analytical and quantitative skills.
