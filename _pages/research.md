## Job Market Paper

**Restricting Video Games in China: Effects on Time Use, Educational Achievement, and Health**  
*Major revision, Journal of Development Economics*  

This paper evaluates China’s 2021 gaming restriction that limits minors’ online play to one hour per day on weekends.  
Using nationally representative panel data (CFPS 2012–2022) and complementary quasi-experimental strategies—including a difference-in-differences design and a regression kink design—I estimate the policy’s effects on minors’ digital behavior, academic performance, and well-being.  
The restriction substantially reduced gaming and total internet use but did not improve study time, academic achievement, or health.  
However, modest gains emerged in academically intensive settings, such as top-track high schools.  
The findings highlight both the power and limits of strict behavioral regulation in improving human capital.

## Working Paper

**Restricting Minors’ Online Gaming: Compliance, Evasion, and Market Responses in China**  

This paper complements my job market paper by analyzing how game developers and players responded to the 2021 regulation.  
Using a self-constructed dataset of mobile game downloads, revenues, and activity—collected through automated web scraping and Python processing—I show that youth-oriented games suffered sharp declines in engagement, while adult games adjusted through content shifts and marketing strategies.  
Event-study and difference-in-differences results reveal that gameplay concentrated on permitted weekends, reflecting behavioral adaptation under algorithmic enforcement.  
The study illustrates how large-scale data and automation can enhance empirical research on technology regulation.

## Research in Progress

**Property Rights and Family Formation: Evidence from China’s 2011 Marriage Law Interpretation**  

This project investigates how clarifying premarital property rights affected marriage and fertility decisions in China.  
Using one-percent population census microdata, I exploit the 2011 judicial interpretation of the Marriage Law as a quasi-experimental shock.  
Preliminary results show that the reform reduced marriage rates and delayed childbirth, especially among urban and higher-educated women, consistent with increased perceived financial risks of marriage.  
This research contributes to understanding how property-rights institutions shape family formation and gender dynamics in developing economies.

## Future Research

My future work extends these projects in several directions:  
- Long-term impacts of digital restrictions on educational, psychological, and labor outcomes.  
- Structural and industrial-organization modeling of firms’ strategic adaptation to digital regulation.  
- Continued research on property rights, housing policy, and demographic change using administrative and census data.  
- New project: the effects of China’s “monetized shantytown redevelopment” program on housing markets and fertility.
